# Return the list of all cookiecuttered repos in the hypothesis GitHub organization.

# This GitHub API search query has stopped returning the correct results.
#
# Until we can figure out how to fix it lets have this script just print a
# hard-coded list of repos so that update_repos.yml can still send cookiecutter
# update PRs to our repos, even if it means we have to manually maintain this
# hard-coded list.
# gh api -X GET search/repositories --paginate -f 'q=cookiecutter.json in:readme org:hypothesis archived:false -repo:hypothesis/hdev' -q '.items | .[] | .full_name'
